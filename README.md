# 🏡 House Price Prediction

This project implements a **Linear Regression model** to predict house prices based on features like:
- Living area (GrLivArea)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is provided by Kaggle (train.csv, test.csv).

## ⚙️ How it works
1. Train a linear regression model on Kaggle’s housing dataset.  
2. Predict prices for the test dataset.  
3. Save predictions to `predictions.csv`.

## 📊 Example Output
The model generates a file named `predictions.csv` with the following format:
Id,SalePrice
1461,169000.25
1462,187500.75
